1. 
Asynchronous nature - I believe this is the case because in our lab when we were shown how function can also operate as variables and thus you can input functions as an argument, it was really confusing. We were then told that this is especially useful for asynch functions or functions with timeout. I think it's really easy to get lost in the sauce with async functions just because of the complexity and timing that you need to get right. 

Loose Typing - this typing is so similar to python and it's really easy to lose track of your work. With java, if you have incorrect typing the compiler will always tell you and you'll spend time fixing it, sometimes even hours. But the point is java doesn't let you mess up too bad without telling you that something is wrong. But with js, it doesn't tell you anything is wrong and instead just tries its best to fix it by having a type conversion for everything imaginable. This can be really annoying. 

Web platform - As told in class when things run on the web, there are packets, lag, people might disconnect, when you implement a game for an individual person if the person disconnects then that just means they end their game. But with networks and browsers when there are multiple people, the platform has to continue even when one persons end is bad. Additionally there are a lot of stuff to keep track of when online. I was extremely confused when using the DevTools as it's so different than what I've dealt with before.

I think they added the synch features because of the fact that online services require packets. If you have a program that doesn't function asynchly, then if there is 1 step that is waiting for a ton of packets, that will hault the entire operation and nothing will get done. 

I think they added type loosely because they want it so that if an error arrises, the application can continue and won't crash. This is especially important for services that require constant uptime and they don't want it to go down at all. Especially if it's an important service for a lot of people. 

3. Javascript is an interpreted language. The key difference is a compiled language is compiled by a compiler into machine code before it is run. But an interpreted language is directly run by an intepretor that interprets the language line by line at run time. This leads to compiled code being faster at execution because they have already been read and translated to the machine while interpreted code takes longer since its being executed as its understood. Compiled languages detect error at compile time while interpreted languages are detected at runtime which means errors might not be caught in time before we already run the code. This gives javascript some advantages such as it's easy to use but some errors are harder to catch.

He wants to focus on vanilla because frameworks are constantly updated and if you use too many dependencies then youll always have to stay up to date with the latest syntax etc. But the fundamentals of js will always stay the same so your code has more consistency and reliability. Sometimes frameworks can be useful though because it allows you to save a lot of time using pre created things instead of building everything up from scratch which will take way longer than our allotted 6 weeks. 

5. 
This relates to our lab because we will be using js and it's important to understand how it functions in order to not mess up. For instance if we just do our project and use random variable types, we might run into a big issue later on and spend lots of time fixing it. It's better to struggle a bit in the beginning to learn the important fundamentals and thus we won't have to spend even more time later on fixing dumb mistakes.
